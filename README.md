# Zomato in Bengaluru: A Geospatial View

This project revolves around a dataset of restaurants listed on Zomato in the city of Bengaluru, India. We will perform extensive data analysis and visualizations to explore various aspects of the restaurant landscape in the city.

## Dataset 

The dataset consists of a wide range of information about the restaurants. Here is what it includes:

1. Whether the restaurant accepts online ordering or not.
2. The type of Restaurant (fine dining, casual, quick bites, etc).
3. The average rating of each restaurant given by customers.
4. Reviews written by customers.
5. The geographical location of each restaurant.
6. The cuisine(s) offered by each restaurant.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to perform:

1. **Rating Analysis:** We will investigate the distribution of ratings among different restaurants, identifying relationship between restaurant rating and presence in online ordering space.

2. **Text Analysis of Online Customer Reviews:** This will involve mining text data from customer reviews, generating insights into customer sentiments and preferences.

3. **N-gram Analysis of Online Customer Reviews:** Unigram, bigram, and trigram analyses will be carried out to discover common phrases and themes present in customer reviews.

4. **Geospatial Analysis:** We aim to extract the longitudes and latitudes of different restaurant locations and create visual representations of these geographical data.

5. **Visualization of Geospatial Data Using Heatmaps:** By leveraging the power of geospatial analysis, we'll generate heatmaps to visually represent the concentration and distribution of restaurants across the city.

## Implementation 

The analyses and visualizations in this project are implemented using various data science and machine learning libraries in Python. The choice of these libraries allows for efficient data manipulation, insightful data analysis, and the creation of interactive, professional-quality visualizations.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, we expect to offer valuable insights into the Bengaluru restaurant landscape as presented on Zomato. This analysis can be beneficial for multiple stakeholders, such as restaurant owners, food bloggers, and customers who want to make informed choices about their dining experiences.
